## Bird Recognition
You are provided reference files of chirps of each bird in a sample set(i.e, consider 3 birds with reference files ref1.wav, ref2.wav and ref3.wav). You are tasked with determining all the birds whose chirps are present in a given audio file.

## Heart rate estimation
Given a noisy ECG signal, you are tasked with filtering out the noisy components and estimate the heart rate of the patient.

## Speech and Loudness detection
Given an audio sample, determine the start and end times of each word spoken in it. Determine which words are relatively emphasised (loud) to the other words.

You can refer to the documentation (in the form of slides, which also contains few of our results) consisting of elaborate explanations of the solutions we came up with for each problem.
